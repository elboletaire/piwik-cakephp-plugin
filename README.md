# Piwik Analytics plugin for CakePHP 1.3.X

This Piwik plugin has a Component and a Helper with an "autotrack" option that will let you integrate it very easyly in your CakePHP site.



## Installation

Unzip / paste the plugin folder to your CakePHP plugins folder

Go to your bootstrap.php file and add this at the bottom of the file:

```php
Configure::write('Piwik', array(
	'piwik_url' => 'http://url.to.your.piwik/installation',
	'site'      => '2', // idSite
	'autotrack' => true
));
```

Save the file and open your app_controller.php file.

Add the piwik component to your components array:

```php
$components = array(
	'Piwik.Piwik'
);
```

That's all. Now your site is tracking every visit to your piwik stats.

By default it takes $title_for_layout as page title.

## Usage and examples

Obviously you can also disable the "autotrack" feature and use the component and the helper feeting it to your own needs.

```php
// Easy tracking method (with curl)
$this->Piwik->track($page_title);
```


```php
// Getting the piwik track image
echo $this->Piwik->track($page_title, 'image');
```

You can also use any method from the [PiwikTracker class](http://piwik.org/docs/tracking-api/#toc-two-tracking-methods-image-tracking-or-using-the-api):

```php
$this->Piwik->setCustomVariable(1, 'city', 'Barcelona');
$this->Piwik->setUrl($this->here);
$this->Piwik->doTrackPageView($page_title);
```

### Displaying widgets

The piwik helper has a method named "widget" that will return an iframe tag for the desired widget:

```php
echo $this->Piwik->widget('UserCountryMap', 'visitorMap');
echo $this->Piwik->widget('VisitsSummary', 'getEvolutionGraph');
```

You can add options to the widget request:

```php
$widget_options = array();
if (!empty($user['User']['piwik_token_auth']))
{
	$widget_options['token_auth'] = $user['User']['piwik_token_auth'];
}
echo $this->Piwik->widget('UserCountryMap', 'visitorMap', $widget_options);
```

And you can of course change the iframe attributes:

```php
echo $this->Piwik->widget('Actions', 'getPageTitles', null, array('width' => 300, 'height' => 300));
```
